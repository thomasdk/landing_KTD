The "Grievance Studies Affair," also known as the "Sokal Squared Scandal," is a fascinating episode in the history of academia. It has sparked intense debates about the integrity of certain fields of study, the peer review process, and the nature of scholarship itself. This blog post aims to provide an overview of the affair, along with relevant resources for further exploration.

## What is the Grievance Studies Affair?

In 2018, three academics — Helen Pluckrose, James A. Lindsay, and Peter Boghossian — embarked on an audacious project. They wrote 20 hoax papers, steeped in what they termed "grievance studies," and submitted them to various academic journals. These papers were deliberately absurd or morally troubling, yet they were presented in the language and methodology of postmodernist thought and identity politics. They exposed biases in fields that study race, gender, sexuality, and other socially charged topics.

The publishing journals include:

- *Gender, Place, and Culture*
- *Hypatia*
- *Sex Roles*
- *Fat Studies*
- *Journal of Poetry Therapy*
- *Affilia*
- *Sexuality & Culture*

The goal? To expose what the authors perceived as a lack of intellectual rigor and an over-reliance on ideology in certain academic fields, including gender studies, queer studies, and race studies.

## The Outcome and Reactions

Of the 20 papers, seven were accepted, seven were still under review, and six were rejected. The project was revealed by the authors themselves in October 2018, leading to a storm of controversy. Some applauded their efforts to expose what they saw as a corrupt academic system, while others condemned it as unethical and misleading.

## Conclusion

The Grievance Studies Affair is a complex and contentious issue that raises important questions about the nature of academic scholarship. Whether one views it as a necessary exposure of flawed systems or an unethical stunt, it's a topic that merits thoughtful discussion and critical examination.

But let's be real: **Don't publish in these junk journals.**
