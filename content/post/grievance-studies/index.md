It sounds like a bad joke: What happens when you rewrite a chapter of Hitler's *Mein Kampf* with feminist buzzwords and submit it to a peer-reviewed academic journal?

The answer, unfortunately, is not that you get laughed out of the room. The answer is that you get accepted.

This is exactly what happened in the "Grievance Studies Affair," also known as "Sokal Squared." In 2018, three academics — Helen Pluckrose, James A. Lindsay, and Peter Boghossian — decided to test the intellectual integrity of certain fields within the humanities. Their hypothesis was simple: If you use the right jargon, validate the right moral prejudices, and conclude that everything is oppressive, you can publish absolute nonsense.

## The Experiment

They didn't just write one paper. They wrote twenty. They created a factory of absurdity, producing papers that argued:

- That dog parks are "petri dishes for canine rape culture" and that men should be trained like dogs.
- That white students should be chained to the floor in classrooms to experience historical reparations.
- That bodybuilding is a fat-exclusionary construct.
- And yes, the infamous rewrite of *Mein Kampf* as an intersectional feminist manifesto.

These weren't submitted to predatory journals. They went to respected, peer-reviewed publications in fields like gender studies, queer studies, and sociology.

## The Result: System Failure

The results were devastating. Of the 20 papers, **seven were accepted**. Four were published online. Seven more were still under review when the story broke.

Reviewers didn't just tolerate the insanity; they celebrated it. One reviewer praised the dog park paper as "incredibly rich and exciting." Another called the *Mein Kampf* rewrite "promising."

The project exposed a terrifying reality: In large swathes of "Grievance Studies," **ideology has completely cannibalized methodology**. Truth is no longer the goal; the goal is to confirm the bias that the world is a system of intersecting oppressions. If your data (even fake data) supports that conclusion, the gates open.

## The Fallout

When the authors revealed the hoax, the reaction was predictable. They were called unethical. They were accused of wasting reviewers' time. They were labeled as right-wing provocateurs (despite being liberals themselves).

But the outrage missed the point. The scandal wasn't that three people lied to journals. The scandal was that the journals **couldn't tell the difference between scholarship and satire**.

If your field cannot distinguish between a serious sociological analysis and a chapter of *Mein Kampf*, your field is not a science. It is a theology.

## Conclusion

The Grievance Studies Affair remains a smoking gun. It proved that in certain corners of academia, the emperor isn't just naked — he's actively publishing papers on why nudity is a social construct imposed by white supremacy.

Don't cite these journals. Don't publish in them. And for the love of science, don't take them seriously.
