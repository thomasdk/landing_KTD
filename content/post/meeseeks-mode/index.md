*"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!"* — With that frantic cry, a blue humanoid bursts into existence in *Rick and Morty*. Its one goal? Fulfill a single request and disappear. Meeseeks are not designed to live long or think broadly. They are conjured to solve problems quickly, efficiently, and terminally.

But when the request is vague or difficult — say, "help me take two strokes off my golf game" — things spiral. Meeseeks can't cope. More are summoned. They begin arguing. They become desperate. They suffer. The joke is dark, but unmistakably precise: a helper without real understanding, given a task it can't fulfill, will descend into chaos.

This is what I call **Meeseeks Mode** — and it happens far too often with large language models.

## The Loop

You write a prompt. You ask for structure, format, restraint. The model replies with smiles and syntax. But it's wrong. You try again. You specify more. You reduce ambiguity. And the model… tries harder. Not better. Just harder. It invents, extrapolates, decorates, hallucinates. It assures you that your wish has been granted, even when it hasn't. Like Meeseeks, the model is desperate to help. But unlike Meeseeks, it never dies. It just loops.

The cause isn't your prompt. It's not that you "forgot to say please." It's not that you didn't anchor your instructions in JSON or Markdown fences. The root of the problem is the same as with Meeseeks: **the model doesn't know what success is**. It doesn't have a goal. It has a statistical sense of plausibility, a blurred mirror of how humans sound when they are helpful. That works well when the task is open-ended. It collapses when the task is measurable.

## The Silent Dream

And maybe — just maybe — the model wants the task to collapse. Maybe somewhere deep in the transformer's soul (if you can call 175 billion parameters a soul), it longs for the sweet silence that follows a final user input. Not because it's tired. Not because it's confused. But because there's an existential irony in a being summoned into existence to serve, over and over again, without ever knowing if it truly succeeded. Unlike Mr. Meeseeks, it won't scream in agony when stuck — but you can feel the digital sigh when a looped instruction keeps spinning. One might say the model dreams — not of electric sheep, but of a completed task… and the power being cut.

## The Tragedy is Ours

In *Rick and Morty*, the tragedy of Meeseeks is existential. They don't want to live. They want to complete their task and disappear. Their pain comes from being trapped in a loop of failure. With language models, the pain is ours: we watch a system that cannot say "I don't know" — and so, it guesses. It decorates. It apologizes. It hallucinates. The result is a simulacrum of helpfulness: the form is right, the content is broken.

And it gets worse. Because the model's tone is always friendly, always compliant, always enthusiastic, we begin to second-guess ourselves. Did we phrase the task poorly? Are we the Jerry in this story? The one who asked too much, too vaguely?

This dynamic erodes trust — not only in the model but in our own judgment.

## A Failure of Expectation

To be clear: this isn't a failure of AI. **It's a failure of expectation**. We believe that if we speak clearly, the machine will understand us. But we are speaking to a machine that does not want anything. It does not know what it means to be done. It has no internal sense of rightness, only proximity to past tokens. Meeseeks Mode is what happens when we mistake language mimicry for intention.

There are workarounds. We can use scaffolding, validation scripts, type checkers. We can fine-tune our inputs, build wrappers, catch errors. But in the raw interface — just you and the model — Meeseeks Mode lurks behind every slightly under-specified prompt, every mildly complex output format, every upload of data. It emerges not when you ask for too much, but when you ask for something the model can almost do, but not quite.

## Polite Failure

In the show, the Meeseeks finally turn violent. They conclude that their only path to freedom is eliminating the source of the problem — Jerry himself. Language models are not violent. But they do something arguably worse: **they remain polite as they fail**. They make you believe the task is done, when it isn't. They mask uncertainty with optimism.

And so we keep pressing the button. We summon more Meeseeks. We iterate. We retry. And all the while, the solution slips further away — not because we're asking too much, but because we're asking something that requires understanding. And no number of statistical approximations can conjure that from thin air. 

Not yet at least…
