abstract: 'This paper
  evaluates information criteria for class identification in multiple indicator growth
  mixture models. This identification of latent classes is evaluated under the simulation
  conditions of missing invariance of the measurement and different class distances.
  The data of this assessment is based on a Monte Carlo simulation study. This paper
  extends previous results by evaluating a broader range of IC-Indices. All previously
  proposed IC measures are examined for their ability to identify latent classes and
  compared with more recent proposals. These include the Hierarchical BIC, which explicitly
  takes the latent class structure into account. The evaluations of the simulation
  results show that the Hierarchical BIC has a completely different identification
  structure than all other IC-Indices and provides comparatively good results with
  small distances between the latent classes.'
